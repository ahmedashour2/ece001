    <center>1. Reduction in Human Error
The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility. Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced majority of human error.
2) Takes risks instead of Humans
This is one of the biggest advantage of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of human by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, minning for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in any kinds of nautural or man made disasters. Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in Ukraine? At that time there were no AI powered robots which can help us to minimise the affect of radiation by controlling the fire in early stages, as any human went close to the core was dead in matter of minutes. They eventually poured sand and boron from helichopters from a mere distance. AI Robots can be used in such situations where an human intervention can be hazardous.
3) Available 24×7
An Average human will work for 4-6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refereshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly off’s to stay intact with their work life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24×7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored unlike humans. Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effecively using AI.
4) Helping in Repetitive Jobs
In our day-to-day work, we will be performing many repetitive works like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors and many more things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative. Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents in order to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying the documents by which both the customers and the owner will be benefited.
5) Digital Assistance
Some of the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to interact with users which saves the need of human resource. The digital assistant also used in many websites to provide things that user want. We can chat with them about what we are looking for. Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it becomes hard to determine that we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being. Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team which needs to clarify the doubts and queries of the customers. Using AI the organizations can set up a Voicebot or Chatbot which can help customers with all their queries. We can see many organizations already started using them in their websites and mobile applications.
6) Faster Decisions:
Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way. Example: We all have played a Chess game in Windows. It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that game. It will take the best possible step in a very short time according to the algorithms used behind it.
7) Daily Applications
Daily applications such as Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, Google’s OK Google are frequently used in our daily routine whether it is for searching a location, taking a selfie, making a phone call, replying to a mail and many more. Example: Around 20 years ago, when we are planning to go somewhere we used to ask a person who already went there for the directions. But now all we have to do is say “OK Google where is Visakhapatnam”. It will show you Visakhapatnam’s location on google map and best path between you and Visakhapatnam.
8) New Inventions:
AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help humans solve the majority of complex problems. Example: Recently doctors are able to predict breast cancer in women at earlier stages using advanced AI-based technologies.</center>
