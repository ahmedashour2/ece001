    fake photo:
False images are as old as photography itself, see for example the famous illusions of the Cottingley fairies or the Loch Ness monster. Then Photoshop brought photo manipulation into the digital age, and now AI is poised to take photo manipulation to a new level. of sophistication and complexity, thanks to artificial neural networks whose algorithms can analyze millions of images of real people and places and use them to create convincing fake images.

Photo Fake: Artificial Intelligence and the Mission of Creating Real Photos A team of researchers from NVIDIA have used an artificial neural network to produce progressively realistic photos based on hundreds of thousands of photos of real celebrities. Credit: NVIDIA Fake photos are as old as photography itself. See, for example, the famous hoaxes of Cottingley's Fairies or the Loch Ness Monster. Then Photoshop introduced image manipulation into the digital age, and now artificial intelligence is poised to take photo manipulation to a new level of sophistication and sophistication, thanks to networking. An artificial neural whose algorithms can analyze millions of images of real people and places and use them to create compelling fake images. These networks consist of interconnected computers arranged in a system based to some extent on the structure of the human brain. has Google, Facebook, and others have used this type of matrix for years to help their software identify people in photos. A new approach includes so-called 'Generative Adversarial Networks' (GANs), which consist of a 'generator' network. Creates images, and a 'distinguished' network that evaluates the authenticity and authenticity of those images.

Neural networks need millions of examples of images to learn from, and competing generator networks are a relatively new way to automatically reproduce these examples, says Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle. Generating networks enable Also competing is artificial intelligence from quickly creating false-realistic images. The generating network uses machine learning to study vast numbers of images that teach it how to make deceptively realistic images, and sends those images to the discriminator network, which is trained to identify What a photo of a real person looks like. The characteristic grid evaluates each of the images generated by the generating grid based on how realistic it is. Over time, the generating network gets better at producing fake images, and the unique network gets better at spotting it, and this This is the reason why it is called a "rival". Competing generator networks have been widely acclaimed as one of the breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. Because, after their initial training, they continue to learn without human supervision. It was Ian Goodfellow, who is now a researcher at Google Brin (Google's Artificial Intelligence Project) - lead author of the 2014 study that introduced this new approach. Since then, dozens of researchers around the world have experimented with competing generator networks for a variety of uses, such as controlling robots. and translation of languages. However, developing these unsupervised systems is a challenge. Competing generating networks sometimes fail to improve over time, so if the generating network cannot produce images that are closer to reality day in and day out, this prevents the discriminating network improvement, too. But chip maker Nvidia has developed a way to train competing networks to help it avoid stalling. The key to this is to progressively train both the generating and discriminating networks by feeding them reduced images. resolution, then adding new layers of pixels that introduce high-resolution detail as the training progresses. This gradual approach to machine learning also cuts training time in half, according to a study that Nvidia researchers plan to present at an international conference on artificial intelligence. In the spring of 2018. Using a database of more than 200,000 celebrity images, the team demonstrated their method to train its rival breeding network that then produced realistic, high-resolution facial images of people who don't exist. The machine does not automatically recognize Whether the image you generate is realistic. “We chose faces as the prime example because it is easy for us humans to judge the success of the generative AI model,” says Jacco Lehtenen, a researcher at Nvidia who is involved in the project. Humans have a nervous mechanism Embedded in their brains receive more training over the course of their lives to recognize and interpret faces.” The challenge here is to get the competing generative networks to emulate these human capabilities.

<center>The birth of robots:
"Badi' al-Zaman Abu al-Izz bin Ismail bin al-Razzaz al-Jazari," a Muslim scholar, was born in 1136 AD on an island that was called "Abu Omar", from which his nickname "Al-Jazari" came. This island was part of the Levant, and today it belongs to Turkey and is located directly on the border line with Syria. What is curious? In this person he was the first man-made animatronic or "robot". At the request of the emir of "Dyarbakir", called "Amed", to make a machine that would replace the servants whenever he wanted to perform ablution for prayer. Al-Jazari made a machine in the form of a boy, erect, with a jug of water in one hand and a towel in the other. In addition to the presence of a bird on the boy’s turban, which whistles whenever the time for prayer comes, and then this boy or servant comes to his master “Amid” to pour water for him in a certain amount, and when he finishes ablution, he presents him with a towel and returns to his place. This "boy" or "prayer robot" was questioned For many scientists, how to know prayer times, in our current world and with technological development, electronic cells can be relied on to act on pre-programmed directions by humans, providing directions and steps that must be taken by the robot. Scientists put a lot Among the hypotheses that discuss how the robot knows prayer times, and how it moves. One of the most prominent of these theories is its dependence on sunlight that enters the room in which it is located, so that a little water evaporates enough to move the joints of the robot, and to urge it to move forward or backward depending on the situation. On the control of several precise scales placed inside this body. This theory applies only during the day and not at night. Al-Jazari's most notable inventions included self-propelled water-powered instruments, measuring instruments, musical instruments, water clocks with a self-alarm system, and the elephant clock In which he collected several parts and tools that represented the civilizations and cultures of his time, and now it is called the "United Nations Hour". Al-Jazari was considered one of the pillars of the Islamic scientific renaissance, which formed the basis for Western scientific civilization later. His book, "The Combined Knowledge" The useful work in crafting tricks” is one of his most prominent books, which he spent about 25 years writing. This book was the main reference for mechanical and hydraulic machines in the Middle Ages, and what distinguished it was the presence of drawings and designs for these machines, and it has been translated into many languages. Most of his manuscripts are in Turkey, such as the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul, and the other part of his manuscripts and studies were bought by several Western countries, including the Netherlands, France (the Louvre Museum), the United States of America (Boston Museum and Oxford University Library), Japan, and Britain.</center>
